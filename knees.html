    <h2>Structure</h2>
    Knees are hinges that connect your upper and lower legs. They allow you to do cool things like walk.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Function</h>
    Knees are the MVP's of your legs. They absorb shock, unless you're me and broke em. Without knees, you'd be like a <span style="color: pink;">flamingo</span> -- but less fabulous.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    Knees start off as tiny bumps on your fetal legs, and they grow and devlop into big bumps on your adult legs.
