  <h1>TOES</h1>
  <p>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    Toes are bony Digits located at the end of the foot. They wiggle.... voraciously.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Function</h2>
    Toes serve a critical role in balancing and walking. Thats why we cram them into shoes with narrow toe beds to make their job harder.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    If you haven't caught on by now, they also develop in the womb. They grow until they fall off eventually (this is to be avoided if you are still alive).
